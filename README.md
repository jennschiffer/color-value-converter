Jenn's Color Conversion Thing
=============================

## What's this supposed to do

This is a collection of functions for converting color values:

1. rgb to hex
2. hex to rgb
3. rgb to color names
4. color names to rgb

I want to learn

1. how to write unit tests (qunit test framework)
2. create a simple library to publish to npm
3. how to convert rgb/hex to color names
4. hsl stuff

Things to research
1. why does qunit cli require the -c flag
2. it has got to be easier to compare arrays with regards to their values,
